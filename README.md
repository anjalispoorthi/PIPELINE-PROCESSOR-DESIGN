4-Stage Pipelined Processor (ADD, SUB, LOAD) in Verilog
This repository houses the Verilog HDL implementation of a 4-stage pipelined processor, designed to execute a foundational set of instructions: ADD, SUB, and LOAD. This project serves as a practical demonstration of pipelining principles and provides a solid base for further processor development. The development leveraged the power of Xilinx tools for synthesis and implementation, Modelsim for rigorous simulation and verification, and Gemini as an invaluable aid for debugging and error detection.

Architectural Overview
The processor adheres to a classic 4-stage pipeline structure, a common approach to enhance instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions. The stages are defined as follows:

Instruction Fetch (IF): This stage is responsible for retrieving the instruction from the instruction memory. The Program Counter (PC) holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched. The fetched instruction is then passed to the subsequent stage along with the updated PC.
Instruction Decode (ID): In this stage, the fetched instruction is decoded, and the necessary operands are read from the register file. The instruction's opcode is analyzed to determine the operation to be performed, and control signals are generated for subsequent stages.
Execute (EX): This stage performs the arithmetic or logical operation specified by the instruction. For ADD and SUB instructions, the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs the addition or subtraction, respectively. For the LOAD instruction, the ALU calculates the memory address.
Memory/Writeback (MEM/WB): This stage handles memory access for LOAD instructions, reading data from the data memory. For all instructions, the result is written back to the register file.
Instruction Set Architecture
The processor supports a simplified instruction set, encompassing the essential operations for basic computation and memory access:

ADD: Adds the values of two source registers and stores the result in a destination register.
SUB: Subtracts the value of one source register from another and stores the result in a destination register.
LOAD: Loads a word from a specified memory address into a destination register.
This instruction set, while basic, provides a fundamental platform for understanding processor design and pipelining concepts.

Implementation Details and Challenges
The implementation is carried out in Verilog HDL, a hardware description language suitable for describing digital circuits. Pipeline registers are strategically placed between stages to hold intermediate results and control signals, ensuring the smooth flow of data through the pipeline. Data hazards, which occur when an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that is still in the pipeline, are addressed through data forwarding. This technique allows results to be forwarded directly from the EX or MEM/WB stages to the ID or EX stage, bypassing the register file and minimizing pipeline stalls. Control signals are meticulously implemented to manage the pipeline's operation, including selecting the appropriate ALU operation, enabling register writes, and controlling memory access.

The development process encountered several challenges, including:

Data Hazard Handling: Implementing effective data forwarding logic required careful consideration of all possible data dependencies and ensuring correct data routing.
Control Signal Generation: Generating the correct control signals for each instruction and pipeline stage required a thorough understanding of the instruction set and pipeline behavior.
Debugging and Verification: Thoroughly testing the processor's functionality required extensive simulation and debugging, particularly in complex scenarios involving data hazards and control flow. Gemini was very useful in detecting errors and suggesting improvements.
